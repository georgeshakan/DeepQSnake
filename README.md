An implementations of Snake in pygame with Deep Q Learning Agent. The code follows [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236).

Currently there are weights for 5 by 5 and 10 by 10 screens. I am still playing around with it. To see it in action:

```console
python display.py
```
